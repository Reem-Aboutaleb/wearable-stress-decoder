# 🩺 Wearable Stress Decoder

This project simulates a real-time wearable system that detects stress using biosignals such as **PPG** (photoplethysmogram) and **EDA** (electrodermal activity).  
It extracts features like **heart rate variability (HRV)** and **skin conductance peaks**, classifies stress levels using machine learning, and visualizes the output on an interactive dashboard.

## 💡 Why This Project?
Wearable stress monitoring has potential in:
- 🧠 Mental health support  
- 🩺 Real-time biofeedback for clinical care  
- 🧪 Cognitive load + emotional state research
